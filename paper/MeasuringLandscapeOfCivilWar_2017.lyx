Abstract:
\series default
 Subnational conflict research increasingly utilizes georeferenced event
 datasets to understand contentious politics and violence.
 Yet, how exactly locations are mapped to particular geographies, especially
 from unstructured text sources such as newspaper reports and archival records,
 remains opaque and few best practices exist for guiding researchers through
 the subtle but consequential decisions made during geolocation.
 We begin to address this gap by developing a systematic approach to georeferenc
ing that articulates the strategies available, empirically diagnoses problems
 of bias created by both the data-generating process and researcher-controlled
 tasks, and provides new generalizable tools for simultaneously optimizing
 both the recovery and accuracy of coordinates.
 We then empirically evaluate our process and tools against new microlevel
 data on the Mau Mau Rebellion (Colonial Kenya 1952-1960), drawn from 20,000
 pages of recently declassified British military intelligence reports.
 By leveraging a subset of this data that includes map codes alongside natural
 language location descriptions, we demonstrate how inappropriately georeferenci
ng data can have important downstream consequences in terms of systematically
 biasing coefficients or altering statistical significance and how our tools
 can help alleviate these problems.

How do we determine where historical acts of violence took place? At the
 heart of many questions in conflict studies is the where of violence: which
 areas were most violent? Where were civilians or communities targeted by
 conflict actors? Where did counterinsurgency tactics succeed or fail? Underlyin
g these analyses are decisions and assumptions about how to map events to
 the geography that they occupied.
 Determining whether an event took place at a specific latitude and longitude,
 in a village or particular administrative unit, or somewhere else altogether
 is a matter of weighing evidence, comparing sources, and making judgment
 calls between different possible georeferencing strategies.
 Such important decisions, however, are usually made in an ad hoc manner,
 on the basis of opaque assumptions, and without the benefit of empirically
 tested guidance.

We begin to address this gap by developing a systematic approach to georeferenci
ng that articulates the strategies available, empirically diagnoses problems
 of bias created by both the data-generating process and researcher-controlled
 tasks, and provides new generalizable tools for simultaneously optimizing
 both the recovery and accuracy of coordinates.
 We are able to do this by exploiting a new source of conflict data from
 the Mau Mau uprising in late colonial Kenya.
 Drawn from over 20,000 pages of archival records, comprising raw intelligence
 reports written by British security personnel, our events contain either
 a natural language location description, a precise military map code, or
 both.
 This allows us to explicitly test differences between georeferencing strategies
 and their relative performance by exploiting comparisons between imputed
 coordinates and the military coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The article proceeds as follows: the next two sections discuss existing
 debates over error and bias in spatial data and provide a brief survey
 of how georeferencing decisions are made across contemporary conflict research.
 We next introduce a new dataset of conflict events during the the Mau Mau
 rebellion, describing the archival records and how we sampled and coded
 them.
 We then discuss the tasks, decisions, and problems of georeferencing event
 data, including the trade-offs that various strategies entail for recovery
 versus accuracy.
 We also develop two new ensemble methods of georeferencing that leverage
 empirical diagnostic information to overcome these trade-offs, flexibly
 combining strategies and data sources to compensate for the weaknesses
 of any one.
 Finally, we empirically demonstrate how inappropriately georeferenced data
 can have important downstream consequences in terms of systematically biasing
 coefficients or altering statistical significance—and how our tools can
 help alleviate these problems.

Scholars have turned increasingly to analyzing subnational variation in
 protests, rebel violence, and repression.
 These works have transformed our understanding of contentious politics,
 allowing us to evaluate theories on the local dynamics of violence, the
 influence of terrain and infrastructure on war, and the myriad strategic
 interactions between states, their challengers, and civilians.
 This rigorous microlevel work depends on georeferenced conflict event datasets,
 which have proliferated in recent years.
 Regional or global event datasets include the Armed Conflict Location and
 Event Dataset (ACLED) (Raleigh et al., 2010), the UCDP Georeferenced Event
 Dataset (UCDP GED) (Sundberg & Melander, 2013), and the Social Conflict
 in Africa Database (SCAD) (Salehyan et al., 2012), among others.

This increasing reliance on event data raises important questions over the
 data generating process and how systematic sources of bias could undermine
 valid causal inferences.
 Conflict event datasets never represent full `ground truth.' Rather, social
 actors with their own perspectives and agendas select events for observation,
 recording, and archiving (Woolley, 2000: 157).
 Journalistic sources, from which much event data has been coded, have come
 under heavy criticism for the small fraction of total events they capture,
 for coverage fatigue, and for bias towards large-scale, violent, and urban
 events (Baum & Zhukov, 2015; Davenport, 2010: 7; Davenport & Ball, 2002;
 Earl et al., 2004; Eck, 2012; O'Loughlin et al., 2010; Weidmann, 2016; Woolley,
 2000).
 Archival records, on the other hand, are usually generated by government
 actors who have their own motives for collecting information during conflict.
 Indeed, they often selectively destroy or censor records and may systematically
 undercount civilian deaths resulting from their own operations (Balcells
 & Sullivan, this issue).

For example, the British are thought to have destroyed countless records
 in their former colonies and hid hundreds of thousands more in a secret
 archive which was only recently discovered (Bennett, 2013: 3).
 In Pakistan, the U.S.
 government considers all military-age males killed in drone strikes as
 combatants unless their civilian status can be verified after the fact—an

Error and bias induced by the researcher controlled processes of data recovery,
 extraction, and coding have received far less attention.
 Machine coding has been critiqued as a method of event compilation due
 to its apparently amplified urban bias and typical reliance on English
 language news sources (Hammond & Weidmann, 2014; Wang et al., 2016).
 Scholars have also noted discrepancies in the spatial accuracy of datasets:
 Eck (2012) finds UCDP-GED outperforms ACLED while Weidman (2015) demonstrates
 that both UCDP-GED and ACLED are highly inaccurate compared to U.S.
 military records from Afghanistan.
 Branch (2016) also notes that georeferencing can introduce unrecognized
 problems with selection bias because it poorly captures non-spatial concepts
 that are then excluded or misrepresented in later analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although highlighting that georeferencing accuracy varies, existing work
 has not yet systematically analyzed how both the data generating process
 and researcher controlled decisions over measuring and modeling the landscape
 of civil conflict create their own biases and inefficiencies.
 Nor have we developed best practices in the field for how to rigorously
 georeference observations.
 This is the contribution we seek to make: how do we best extract locations
 from raw data and assign them coordinates? Georeferencing is a process
 of the researcher's own creation and under their control: while we cannot
 resolve all the myriad challenges arising from how records were generated,
 we can minimize our own contribution to bias and measurement error.

Within the burgeoning microlevel literature on contentious politics, it
 has not yet become standard practice to describe georeferencing procedures
 such that they are fully transparent and replicable.
 Even frequently used global event datasets such as the Global Terrorism
 Database (GTD) and the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)
 fail to specify in their documentation exactly how coordinates were obtained
 from location names (toponyms).

\begin_layout Standard
From those works that do describe their geolocation methods, three general
 practices can be discerned: reliance on GPS or satellite data, binning
 events into administrative units, or matching location names to coordinates
 through gazetteer databases.
 First, for some modern conflicts, GPS-enabled field equipment or satellite
 coverage provide highly accurate geographic information.
 The `Significant Activities' database was collected by U.S.
 soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq with the technological capabilities to
 include GPS coordinates in their field reports (Berman et al., 2011; Berman,
 Shapiro & Felter, 2011; Berman et al., 2013; Condra et al., 2010; Condra
 & Shapiro, 2012; Gleditsch & Weidmann, 2012; Shapiro & Weidmann, 2015).
 Hassan & O'Mealia (this issue) use satellite data to pinpoint arson events
 during the 2007-2008 Kenyan election violence.
 This type of geographical data is highly accurate and avoids the problems
 of later deriving coordinates from location descriptions.
 It is, however, also rare.
 Historic actors did not have such technological capabilities and even many
 contemporary governments (and other armed actors) do not have the resources,
 capacity, or will to collect GPS data in the field.
 There is also a very limited range to the types of data satellite imagery
 can capture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More commonly, researchers forgo coordinates and bin events within existing
 administrative units.
 This is the case for much microlevel data collected on individual conflicts,
 including Chechnya (Lyall, 2009), Columbia (Albertus & Kaplan, 2012), Pakistan
 (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2015), Palestine (Benmelech, Berrebi & Klor,
 2015), the Philippines (Berman et al.
 2011; Crost, Felter & Johnston, 2014), Spain (Balcells, 2010), Ukraine
 (Zhukov, 2015), and Vietnam (Kocher, Pepinsky & Kalyvas, 2011; Douglass,
 2016).
 This approach avoids the problems of georeferencing while still reaching
 low levels of spatial aggregation, such as villages (although more commonly
 events are assigned to districts or municipalities).
 This practice, however, is non-ideal insofar as it compels the researcher
 to choose an administrative unit of analysis for practical reasons that
 may later conflict with theoretical needs or endogeneity concerns.
 Accurate and reliable conversion to coordinates would allow for greater
 flexibility over model specification, facilitate geographic matching and
 combination with other variables, and enable better use of data by future
 researchers driven by other questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a growing number of conflict event datasets match toponyms to coordinat
es through publicly available databases, such as the GeoNet Names Server
 or Google Earth, as well as historic gazetteers, field atlases, and other
 digitized maps.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ACLED, for example, uses a combination of the National Geospatial-Intelligence
 Agency's GeoNet Names Server (GeoNames), Google maps, Falling Grain, and
 other unspecified gazetteers (see codebook for Raleigh et al., 2010).
 UCDP-GED matches to GeoNames first then, failing that, consults Google
 Earth, followed by unspecified digitized maps and field atlases (Sundberg
 and Melander 2013, 526).
 SCAD works with a combination of Yahoo! Maps, Falling Grain, and www.itouchmap.co
m/latlong (see codebook for Salehyan et al., 2012).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Although the technical procedures remain opaque, it appears that most of
 these efforts begin with a primary database and then work sequentially
 through alternatives until a match is found between the location name and
 a set of coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This haphazard approach poses a number of potential problems.
 First, it prioritizes recovery rates over accuracy by consulting sources
 of varying and often unknown quality until coordinates have been tracked
 down.
 Second, it fails to systematically consider what the best match is out
 of a range of possibilities within and across databases.
 This creates unneccessary spatial error.
 Third, manually consulting a broad range of databases and other sources
 of geographic information is highly labor intensive.
 Large amounts of data may then be left missing, especially for projects
 led by small teams of researchers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both missing coordinate data and spatial error are unlikely to be random.
 Georeferencing processes can thus carry over and create additional sources
 of bias that affect later analysis.
 This makes it vital to first render visible the important decisions made
 during georeferencing that affect the recovery rate, accuracy, and bias
 of coordinates.
 New tools are then necessary to assist the researcher in implementing the
 best georeferencing process for their event data, given its unique problems.

\begin_layout Standard
The process of georeferencing, or matching textual descriptions of places
 to standardized identifiers (such as coordinates) through databases of
 geographic information (gazetteers), involves two fundamental concerns:
 precision (accuracy) and recall (recovery).
 Imprecision can seep into imputed coordinates through a wide variety of
 mechanisms: from errors in the data generating process that placed events
 far from their true locations, to mispellings or duplicated place names
 that lead to false matches, to errors in the underlying gazetteer data.
 The data generating process and georeferencing method can similarly affect
 recall rates.
 For example, records may give vague location information that is difficult
 to match to any gazetteer while some matching techniques, especially those
 requiring an exact match between location and gazetteer names, necessarily
 leave many observations missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If coordinates were truly missing at random, then low recall rates would
 simply reduce our sample size and downstream statistical leverage.
 Similarly, if inaccuracies were random, then low precision would merely
 introduce statistical noise and make relationships more difficult to discern,
 but would nonetheless return unbiased estimates.
 If the accuracy and/or missingness of coordinates are systematically distorted,
 however, then our later analyses would be subject to meaningful sources
 of potentially unacknowledged bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is therefore vitally important to understand how both the data generating
 process, in each unique context of data collection, and the georeferencing
 process create missing and/or inaccurate location information.
 Given this understanding, the researcher can tailor geolocation to minimize
 both its own problems and those that would otherwise carry over from the
 data generating process.
 Evaluating and implementing good strategies of georeferencing, in turn,
 rely on better tools that explicitly address the problems of precision
 and recovery and the potential trade-offs between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this section develops a systematic approach to georeferencing,
 including novel matching tools, with several benefits for the researcher.
 First, it eliminates the need to ex ante prioritize or exclude gazetteers,
 allowing the researcher to develop an individualized collection of sources
 that can be simultaneously consulted.
 Second, it systematically considers and derives best matches both within
 and across these sources, removing the labor intensive and somewhat haphazard
 task of trying to `hand match' locations to coordinates.
 Third, it provides flexible tools for maximizing recovery rates, minimizing
 inaccuracy, or balancing trade-offs between them.
 Fourth, it allows `self-referential' matching—or using coordinate locations
 included in the event observations themselves to provide matches for other
 observations missing this information.
 Finally, it provides complete transparency in the subtle but meaningful
 choices that are usually opaquely left to the researcher (or research assistant
) when trying to geolocate event data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A systematic approach to georeferencing involves four key choices, all of
 which potentially affect both recovery and precision (see Table II).
 We discuss each of these choices in turn, giving recommendations for best
 practices or describing the trade-offs between options.
 We then present two new tools we developed to facilitate georeferencing
 according to these best practices.

Which coordinate sources?
\emph default
: First, the researcher must choose which gazetteers to use and how to potential
ly combine them.
 Not all gazetteers are created equal and, given the expanding number of
 available geographic information sources, the best are not readily apparent.
 For example, we found ten different coordinate sources for Kenya, ranging
 from historic gazetteers to government databases to commercial application
 programming interfaces (APIs) such as Google Earth and Bing Maps.
\begin_inset Foot

Kenya coordinate sources include: the 1964 Official Kenya Gazetteer; the

 Full source documentation is included in the online appendix.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Instead of relying on general reputation (or even ease of access) to choose
 one data source, or to sequentially consult a small subset of sources,
 we recommend initially combining all data sources into a master gazetteer.
 This allows for diagnostics and comparisons of recovery rates and accuracy
 between gazetteers.
 It also enables the application of more sophisticated tools that can rank
 matches across gazetteers and suggest a best match for each individual
 observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Allow self-referential matching?
\emph default
: Datasets compiled from records that provide GPS or map coordinates, for
 at least some subset of observations, allow the researcher to engage in
 `self-referential matching.' By this we mean recovering coordinates for
 observations with only natural language location descriptions by matching
 them to other observations in the dataset rather than to external gazetteers.
 This practice can potentially greatly enhance recovery rates.
 Small rural locations, such as markets or farms, may not be included in
 global or even country-level gazetteers or may change names over time.
 They may, however, be consistently referred to by conflict actors generating
 records in close temporal and spatial proximity.
 If, even once, such a location receives a coordinate in a document, then
 that geographic information can be recovered for all observations sharing
 the location name.
 The trade-off is that this practice will automatically spread any bias
 or error from these replicated coordinates throughout the dataset.
 One must thus carefully evaluate the underlying reliability of the actor-genera
ted coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Which geometry type?
\emph default
: Third, the researcher must choose the types of geometry to match on.
 The most common, point matching, treats locations as a single geographic
 point.
 Another possibility attributes polygons or multipolygons to locations and
 matches accordingly, which holds advantages for larger locations like towns
 and administrative units that we might feel uncomfortable reducing to a
 single point in space.
 Additionally, geographic features such as rivers can be treated as linestrings.
 Geometries can also theoretically be combined, assigning each location
 the point or shape with greatest verisimilitude.
 Different geometries may, however, involve trade-offs or sacrifices in
 recovery and accuracy and should be empirically judged within each context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Type of string matching?
\emph default
: Finally, two general options exist to recover coordinates: exact matching
 and fuzzy matching.
 Exact matching requires an identical letter for letter match between toponyms
 in the event data and the gazetteer sources.
 The technique thus entails high precision (matches are likely true) but
 low recall.
 Indeed, many potential matches are missed due to minor deviations between
 sources, such as spelling errors, different prefixes and suffixes, and
 other modifiers (such as Aberdere National Forest versus Aberdere Forest).
 Intensive hand cleaning can partially overcome these disadvantages by fixing
 such discrepancies to the greatest degree possible; but recovery rates
 will nonetheless likely remain relatively low.
 Fuzzy matching, on the other hand, allows for toponyms to differ and still
 constitute a match, where the task is to carefully define the allowable
 degree of difference.
 Fuzzy matching thus has high recall, compared to exact matching, but may
 also generate many false matches, reducing precision.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Given the current lack of appropriate tools, we built a custom fuzzy toponym
 matching pipeline, treating it as a supervised learning problem.
 A full description of the pipeline and evaluation of its performance is
 provided in the online appendix.
 In brief, we created a training dataset of events with both text and military
 map codes paired against the ten closest gazetteer entries to the true
 location.
 We coded each event toponym-gazetteer dyad (n=20,243) as a match (3,192)
 or mismatch (17,051).
 A two stage classifier was then trained to predict the likelihood of a
 match between any two arbitrary toponym pairs.
 The first stage screened out pairs with little chance of being a match,
 using the Jaccard similarity between their 2-character ngram profiles,
 approximated with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).
 A second stage then refined this smaller number of plausible matches using
 28 different measures of similarity and estimated an exact probability
 with an XGBoost model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The researcher must thus decide whether missing data or geospatial error
 is of greater risk to downstream analysis before choosing a string matching
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These choices often present trade-offs which are difficult to optimize across
 the entire georeferencing process.
 Ideally, we want to recover as many observations as possible, drawing across
 all available data sources and georeferencing methods, while still retaining
 precision.
 To help achieve this, we developed two new tools that generate as many
 likely matches for as many observations as possible, while simultaneously
 sorting those suggestions by predicted accuracy.
 Below, we provide an intuitive insight into each tool with full technical
 details described in the online appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Fixed hand rules ensemble
\emph default
: This is an automated tool that requires the researcher to first evaluate
 which methods and gazetteers perform best, given their data, in terms of
 accuracy.
 Fixed rules are then programmed which tell the ensemble tool which matches
 to prioritize across observations.
 For example, we found that for our Kenya data exact matches were preferred
 to fuzzy matches, self-referential matches to gazetteer matches, and points
 to other geometric forms.
 We were also able to rank order our gazetteer sources by overall accuracy.
 Thus the tool was programmed to first generate possible matches across
 georeferencing strategies and then to select the one that best meets our
 customized preference ordering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Semi-supervised ensemble
\emph default
: While fixed rules are relatively easy to implement, they are inflexible
 and uniformly applied.
 This neglects additional information that could be used to pick the best
 possible match on a case by case basis, further minimizing imprecision
 and bias.
 The semi-supervised ensemble treats georeferencing as a supervised learning
 problem, predicting how far away a potential match is from the true location.
 This necessitates a moderately sized training dataset of ideal matches
 where observations have both a place name and known true location.
 This requirement may not be met by some datasets, especially those drawn
 exclusively from media sources.
 The model works by calculating the actual distance between known points
 and potential matches in the gazetteers, learning to predict this distance
 as a function of event and gazetteer properties such as reporting district,
 conflict year, data source, matching type, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We fit an XGBoost model, described later in the section `Choosing the right
 georeferencing approach for Kenya,' which predicts the log distance in
 kilometers between an event location and a gazetteer suggestion, minimizing
 mean squared error.
 Our unit of analysis is the event-gazetteer dyad (N=340,355) and the model
 includes the following independent variables: match properties such as
 the underlying gazateer source, spatial type, exact or fuzzy matching,
 and self-match; the predicted probability of a fuzzy match being true estimated
 with the second stage of the toponym matcher introduced above; place types
 from the gazetteers such as village, town, road, river, district, etc.;
 and document properties such as the reporting district and year.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The tool learns which potential match is likely to be the most accurate
 given all of this underlying information, flexibly applying its decision-making
 observation by observation.
 This provides a more flexible approach than the fixed rules ensemble and
 is highly customizable given the unique needs and constraints of other
 geospatial data collection efforts.

This sections employs our set of tools in the Kenyan context to, first,
 show how our data generating process created important biases that necessitated
 maximizing both recovered coordinates and their precision.
 Second, we give a proof of concept demonstrating how different georeferencing
 strategies create relative bias in how events are placed in relation to
 variables commonly thought to influence conflict dynamics—including population
 density and terrain ruggedness—and that those biases alter both coefficients
 and p-values when conducting simple hypothesis testing on the intensity
 of violence during the Mau Mau uprising.
 This particular dataset grants us vital leverage to evaluate and compare
 georeferencing strategies because it contains a subset of events with both
 natural language location descriptions and military generated map coordinates.

Best practices in constructing archival data, as recommended in the introductory
 article to this issue, require strong awareness of the data generating
 process and transparency in reporting it.
 How records were created, preserved, archived, and accessed creates potential
 sources of bias and determines the universe of events to which findings
 can legitimately speak.
 It is also recommended that researchers collect information using basic
 and unambiguous categories and highly disaggregated spatial and temporal
 units.
 This minimizes coder induced bias while preserving the fine-grained nature
 of the available records: categories and units can always be scaled up
 later in theoretically meaningful ways.
 Following these recommendations, we describe a new microlevel dataset on
 the Mau Mau uprising in late colonial Kenya (1952-1960).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On 21 October 1952, in response to a string of murders and growing unrest,
 the colonial government of Kenya declared a State of Emergency.
 Growing out of land grievances within the Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru (henceforth
 Kikuyu) tribal reserves, Mau Mau violence was targeted simultaneously at
 the colonial state, collaborating tribal chiefs and their locally recruited
 Home Guards, white settlers, and fellow Kikuyu who refused to participate
 in oathing ceremonies.
 These rituals were designed to silence the non-combatant population and
 bind their loyalty to the rebels.
 While the armed forces battled guerrilla gangs in the forests, the native
 reserves turned into an intra-ethnic civil war, with much of the violence
 directed at Kikuyu non-combatants (Bennett, 2013: 12; Branch, 2009: 6;
 Furedi, 1973; Kershaw, 1997: 212-247).
 Both sides were brutal: the government and its allies engaged in aerial
 bombardment, forced villagization, mass detentions, and extrajudicial torture
 and killings; and the insurgents routinely practiced targeted assassinations,
 massacres, arson campaigns, and the beating and murder of civilians (see
 Anderson, 2006; Bennett, 2013; Branch, 2009; Elkins, 2005).
 The military phase of the Emergency ended in October 1956 when the last
 Mau Mau leader, Dedan Kimathi, was captured.
 Emergency regulations and many tactics of pacification in the reserves
 were not lifted, however, until 12 January 1960.
 According to official statistics, the conflict cost the lives of approximately
 1,200 members of the Kenyan security forces (mostly Home Guard), 10,000-20,000
 insurgents, and some 25,000 civilians (French, 2011: 151).

A sophisticated demographic study confirms that the total `excess deaths'
 amongst the Kikuyu was likely between 30,000-60,000 (Blacker, 2007: 225).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conflict event data was recorded and compiled throughout the emergency by
 Special Branch, an intelligence unit within the police.
 Relying on the pre-conflict intelligence infrastructure of the colonial
 state, Special Branch officers assembled police and military intelligence
 from a wide range of sources into weekly, bimonthly, or monthly reports
 at the district and provincial levels.
 The purpose of these reports was to track conflict dynamics for local civilian
 and military administrators as well as for higher distribution to the wartime
 intelligence committees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the format varied across both time and space, each report contained
 some type of operational intelligence section with either a table of incidents
 or narratives of events.
 Because both police and military sources were consulted, a wide range of
 incidents were tracked, including both violent and non-violent events (oathings
, theft, arson, abductions, assaults, killings, etc.).
 The incident lists also include government counterinsurgency activities,
 such as screening and sweep operations, patrols, and contacts between military
 units and rebels.
 Event descriptions include the date, location (often referenced with a
 military map code), a brief description of what occurred, and counts of
 arrested, wounded, and killed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the conflict, as decolonization approached, these files were removed
 from Kenya and buried from public view.
 It was only in 2011, following lawsuits filed against the United Kingdom's
 Foreign and Commonwealth Office—for torture committed during the Mau Mau
 uprising—that a hidden archive was discovered at Hanslope Park, Her Majesty's
 Government Communications Centre (Bennett, 2013: 3).
 Known as the `Migrated Archives' or the FCO 141- series, the records were
 deposited in tranches into the British National Archives at Kew between
 April 2012 and November 2013.
 They contain hundreds of thousands of pages of military and administrative
 documents detailing the violence that consumed late colonial Kenya.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Out of the massive volume of available documents, we sampled the Special
 Branch reports because of their comprehensive coverage.
 Contained in 59 dossiers, the reports for the entire period of the Emergency
 have survived for most affected districts, with the exception of Fort Hall
 (missing after August 1954) and Machakos (missing after December 1955).

 Moreover, these reports and the intelligence infrastructure that compiled
 them both pre- and post-dated the uprising as well as existed in non-affected
 districts.
 We could thus rely on the content of the documents to tell us the geographic
 and temporal range of conflict events, instead of being subject to the
 government's judgment.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Despite the comprehensive coverage of the documents, some notable sources
 of potential bias remain.
 First, the intelligence records may not systematically capture major government
 operations in the heart of the forest zones, where the Mau Mau were encamped
 and civilians prohibited (these were outside district reporting boundaries).
 Second, because these records relied on military and police sources, they
 could undercount violent offenses by the government against civilians.
 Civilians would have been less likely to come forward with their experiences
 and security forces would have been less likely to document their own crimes.
 Finally, some Kenyan security forces were notorious for considering any
 man of military age caught outside his home area without proper papers,
 or in the act of running away, as a rebel.
 They also often deemed anyone they shot or injured as a rebel to protect
 themselves from investigation and possible prosecution for civilian abuses.
 We thus have low confidence that the data accurately distinguish between
 rebels and civilians.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the intelligence files, we coded 10,469 conflict events with nuanced
 information on the event and its location.
 We categorized each event by type and then coded both the instigator and
 target.
 Data on casualties and captures was also extracted from the files, where
 available.
 Following best practices, we preserved as much disaggregation in the data
 as possible and used basic and unambiguous conceptual categories that can
 be aggregated into more theoretically driven concepts.
 For example, for the event type, coders were asked to extract brief original
 language descriptors from the event narratives summarizing the incident.
 We then pulled a list of all the unique descriptors from the compiled data
 and sorted them into basic categories before aggregating to larger concepts.
 The category `physical violence' thus includes the subcategories of `abduction'
 (`abduction' and `kidnapping'), `assault' (`assault' and `attack'), and
 `murder' (`murder' and `elimination').
 The same process was followed for coding the instigator and target of the
 event.
 This procedure allowed us to preserve a high degree of disaggregation and
 transparency, to avoid creating missing data by failing to appropriately
 specify categories ex-ante, and to minimize reliance on coder classificatory
 judgment.

To understand whether underlying biases in the data generating process drove
 these differences, and how that should impact our georeferencing strategy,
 we modeled how both the properties of government data collection efforts
 (district, year, length of time window covered) and important attributes
 of the events themselves (initiator, target, and type of event) relate
 to location information.
 At several points, including here, we perform regression and classification
 tasks utilizing a non-parametric, machine-learning technique called Extreme
 Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) that works with both
 categorical and continuous independent variables.
 XGBoost is an ensemble method that iteratively fits individual models,
 with each new model designed to address the errors of proceeding models
 (called a greedy function approximator) (Friedman, 2001).
 The individual models comprise decision trees, which progressively split
 the data into smaller subsets similar in outcome as a function of the covariate
s.
 Each split represents a single cut on a single covariate.
 The trees are grown until reaching a stopping condition: a leaf node with
 only a single value on the outcome for classification and a leaf node with
 no less than three values for regression.
 For each observation, predictions from each tree are then weighted into
 a final prediction.
 To avoid over-fitting, each tree only has access to a random subset of
 observations and covariates.
 The majority of the technical discussion is relegated to the online appendix,
 including hyper-parameters, loss functions, training and test splits, cross
 validation, and class imbalance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that events with military map codes are systematically different
 from those with only text descriptions.
 We fit a model that attempts to predict the likelihood of an event missing
 military map coordinates as a function of properties of that event.
 We find missingness to be nonrandom, with the model having high out of
 sample predictive accuracy (AUC 0.88).
 Figure 1 shows how missingness varies with each covariate, measured as
 the predicted likelihood of missing map coordinates when setting a covariate
 to a specific value and holding all others at their observed value.
 The covariates are ordered top left to bottom right in terms of their measured
 importance to the overall model.
 Missing location information was most strongly related to the properties
 of the underlying intelligence document, suggesting that, when compiling
 any microlevel dataset, the unique data generating process of recording
 and preserving information is vital to understand.
 Certain kinds of reports, particularly those covering longer time periods
 and issued less regularly, were much less likely to contain exact coordinates
 compared to regularly issued weekly reports.
 Likewise, different years of the war were more likely to exclude spatial
 information than others.
 Reports from 1952, the first year of the Emergency, were about 40% less
 likely to have coordinates than in 1955, probably reflecting disorganization
 as the state struggled to mobilize resources to counter the rebellion.
 The reporting district was also strongly predicted receiving a military
 map code.
 For example, events in the Fort Hall district files almost always contained
 specific coordinates while Nairobi city files nearly exclusively relied
 on textual descriptions.
 Provincial files and outlying districts from the conflict zone were also
 more likely to lack coordinates, with Machakos District around 75% less
 likely to report map codes than Fort Hall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we found variation in geographic reporting across action, target,
 and perpetrator of the event, with certain kinds of events in the war receiving
 systematically greater spatial coverage than others.
 Thefts and security operations were more likely to have coordinates than
 oathings or rebel captures.
 Events initiated by government actors, or against certain government actors
 (e.g.
 King's African Rifles and Police), were also more likely to have contain
 coordinates than others.
 Therefore, even though the government can give the appearance of capturing
 both sides of a conflict, the quality of that information may still vary
 systemically.
 How researchers choose to handle this missingness of spatial information
 will thus have important consequences for their analyses.

The data generating process in late colonial Kenya thus created serious
 sources of bias in the accuracy and missingness of location information
 preserved by archival records.
 To drop observations without military map codes, or fail to recover a large
 percentage of them, would certainly bias later analysis.
 But so too would recovering a high volume of inaccurate coordinates, given
 the underlying processes that determined which events received map codes
 versus location names.
 To conduct downstream analysis, we were thus confronted with the pressing
 problem of simultaneously attempting to maximize recall and precision while
 geolocating events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this analysis is particular to the Mau Mau context, the same problems
 likely apply to many conflict settings.
 Simply omitting events with vague or missing location information would
 systematically undercount events from certain parts of the country and
 years of the conflict, which are often correlated with important patterns
 of spatial and temporal violence.
 It would also systematically undercount civilian and rebel initiated acts
 as well as certain categories of rebel behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To maximize both accuracy and recovery of coordinates, we compared the performan
ce of different georeferencing strategies and gazetteer sources, leveraging
 a subset of our observations that possessed both natural language location
 descriptions as well as reported military map codes.
 For each georeferencing technique and gazetteer, we graphed its recall
 rate against the mean squared error between the recovered coordinates and
 the military map codes.
 This evaluation required an untestable assumption: that the military map
 codes represent a close approximation to `ground truth' or the true location
 of events.
 Of course, soldiers in the field in the 1950s did not benefit from access
 to modern GPS equipment, which could introduce inaccuracies or biases into
 the military coordinates themselves.
 We think this is a minimal problem for two reasons: first, soldiers were
 working from high resolution local maps built from recently conducted aerial
 photography.
 They thus had reasonably good tools at their disposal to locate their own
 position, or incidents reported to them, using the natural features of
 the landscape, the road network, and nearby villages and farms.
 Second, the East Africa Grid System, in which they were working, used layered
 boxes to pin point positions which allowed soldiers to report map codes
 of varying levels of accuracy.
 If they were unsure of their precise location, they could use a slightly
 bigger box (and we do observe high volumes of both 7- and 9-digit map codes).
 Soldiers could also decline to use map codes altogether, as was often the
 case and likely to occur where grid coordinates would not improve upon
 simpler text descriptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 shows the relative performance of each individual gazetteer and
 georeferencing strategy along both dimensions of recall and precision.
 The upper left hand corner represents the choices that best meet our needs,
 maximizing recovery while minimizing the distance to known military coordinates.
 The best performing gazetteers for our task are thus GeoNames, the NGA,
 and the historic 1964 Official Kenya Gazetteer.
 This was our most contemporary source of geographic information to the
 conflict itself, constructed from United Kingdom Survey of Kenya maps generated
 between 1953-1962.
 The Survey of Kenya maps were, in turn, based on aerial photography conducted
 in 1952 by the British Royal Air Force.

 Openstreetmap and Google, on the other hand, performed particularly poorly.
 With regard to georeferencing strategies, some choices were outright superior,
 while others involved important tradeoffs.
 Point matching, for example, outperformed all other types of geometry along
 both dimensions.
 On the other hand, exact matching maximized accuracy while fuzzy matching
 allowed for higher recovery rates.
 These results are unique to our data and would naturally vary in other
 contexts.

Using these diagnostics, we then created preference orderings for the fixed
 rules ensemble.
 The semi-supervised ensemble also incorporated this information, as well
 as other observational attributes such as the reporting district, year,
 and report type as these were shown in the earlier analysis to structure
 missingness.

 of observations.
 Both the hand based rules and the semi-supervised ensemble had comparable
 precision with root mean squared error of 31km and 30km respectively.

Paying close attention to the data-generating process, making informed choices
 over georeferencing methods, and following best practices should pay empirical
 dividends.
 Our data should be more reliable and less prone to bias than if we had
 made alternative choices.
 We test this in two ways.
 First, we analyze how different choices over gazetteers and georeferencing
 strategies generate relative bias in how close or far events are placed
 in relation to common variables of interest, including population density,
 distance from roads, and terrain ruggedness.
 Second, we examine how these same choices can bias coefficients or alter
 p-values in a simple hypothesis testing model with conflict intensity as
 the dependent variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first analysis once again rests on leveraging the subset of our observations
 that have both location descriptions and military map coordinates.
 For each gazetteer, using the imputed coordinates, we calculate the average
 value of five commonly used independent variables and then compare them
 to the presumed `true values' generated by the military map codes.
 We chose distance to a road, density of forest cover, population density,
 volume of rainfall, and ruggedness of terrain as each of these variables
 is frequently employed in analyses of insurgency and contentious politics
 and claimed to impact patterns of violence (see Table 4 for variable descriptio
ns and sources).
 For example, security forces heavily utilize road networks, making them
 targets for IEDs and other attacks.
 Difficult terrain, such as dense forest cover and ruggedness, provide hiding
 places for insurgents, facilitating and prolonging conflict.
 Population centers provide large concentrations of targets as well as sources
 of supply and cover for insurgents blending into the civilian population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that georeferenced locations are systematically different from coordinat
es provided by the military.
 Figure 4 shows the mean difference between imputed points and known military
 coordinates across each of the different gazetteer sources, organized by
 variable.
 With rare exceptions, the various gazetteers placed events closer to roads
 (by about 25%), in more populated areas (by about 30%), and with less rainfall
 (by about 10%).
 Perhaps more importantly, different gazetteers created distinct sources
 of bias both within and across variables.
 Ruggedness and forest cover, for example, varied significantly in the magnitude
 and direction of bias depending on the underlying source gazetteer.
 Users of event data, and consumers of the research based in it, have little
 ability to predict such biases and adjust inferences accordingly without
 conducting the diagnostics that we have.
 Additionally, to the degree that researchers wish to understand the role
 of these variables in producing or conditioning conflict events, careless
 or inappropriate georeferencing strategies could mechanically create relationsh
ips that will bias downstream analysis.

We now illustrate the impact of georeferencing decisions on a standard hypothesi
s testing model.
 We fit a negative binomial regression predicting the intensity of conflict
 in Kenya within a given geographic area (10km wide hexagons) as a function
 of our five independent variables (population, rainfall, distance from
 roads, ruggedness, and forest cover).
 Not only are these variables routinely included in conflict models, but
 they have particular relevance to the Kenyan context.
 The Mau Mau maintained their bases high up in the Aberderes and Mt.
 Kenya forests and were targeted there by government security forces, both
 by ground troops and aerial bombardment (Anderson, 2005: 230-288).
 Much of the conflict, however, likely occurred at the borders between the
 forests and the settled area as rebel bands ventured down, seeking supplies
 and support from the civilian population.
 It was here that they came into contact both with loyalists and with patrolling
 security forces (Bennett, 2013: 20-26).
 For similar reasons, population density also likely shaped the dynamics
 of violence as the heavily populated Kikuyu tribal reserves became a battlegrou
nd between the Mau Mau and the local defense forces, with civilians and
 their loyalties caught in between (Branch, 2009: 55-93).
 The road network served as an artery of security force patrols, potentially
 enhancing population security closer to paved roads but also providing
 a target for rebel attacks.
 Finally, rainfall directly impacts agricultural quality and the productivity
 of land.
 Since Mau Mau arose over land disputes and the growing wealth disparities
 both within the Kikuyu community and compared to the white settle population,
 we might expect more conflict events around highly productive land (Kershaw,
 1997: 212-241).

 model predicting the count of events occurring in 10km hexagon bins as
 a linear function of five covariates and an error term.
 Each box represents a single covariate and displays how the p-value (y-axis)
 and exponentiated coefficient (x-axis) shift as different georeferencing
 strategies and source gazetteers are used to construct the underlying data
 prior to spatial binning.
 Three outliers take extreme values, primarily because of low recovery rates,
 and are not shown.

Even in this simple model with few covariates, we find wide variation in
 substantive effect, significance, and sign across the georeferencing strategies.
 Population and rainfall demonstrate the least ambiguous effects, their
 coefficients uniformly positive (with one exception) and always statistically
 significant.
 The magnitude of their coefficients, however, ranges greatly: a one unit
 increase in log population creates anywhere from a 1.5 to 3 fold increase
 in conflict intensity while the same increase in log rainfall generates
 8 to 30 times as many conflict events.
 All results thus support the understanding that more highly populated communiti
es on good land were disproportionately impacted by the conflict; how disproport
ionately varies by the georeferencing method.
 Distance from roads also consistently decreases conflict intensity across
 models, although there is wide variation on whether the effect gains statistica
l significance.
 Depending on our georeferencing strategy, we might thus conclude that roads
 fail to matter or that police and military patrols facilitated by paved
 roads greatly improve security, at least in this context.
 Finally, the results for ruggedness vary drastically in terms of statistical
 significance and the sign of the coefficient even flips for several gazetteer
 sources.
 Tree cover is also severely impacted, with no consistency in the sign,
 magnitude, or statistical significance of the coefficient.
 Given the importance of forests and mountains to both rebel and government
 strategies in the Kenyan context, this is worrisome indeed.
 Getting the georeferencing wrong would prevent us from generating valid
 inferences on a central dynamic of this conflict.

Microlevel conflict analyses involve a host of typically hidden decisions
 over how to handle the spatial components of event data, beginning with
 the georeferencing process itself.
 We demonstrate that these choices have clear consequences for downstream
 analysis, including the validity and interpretation of statistical results.
 Yet, no clear best practices currently exist in the field to guide the
 complex process of mapping events to their geographies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article attempts to fill this void, leveraging original data on the
 Mau Mau rebellion to flush out the decision making process of retrieving
 coordinates while developing new tools for maximizing recovery and minimizing
 error and bias.
 We demonstrate diagnostics that can be used to understand the data generating
 process and how the social actors who recorded and archived events introduced
 systematic bias into geographic missingness.
 We also provide simple, empirically informed guidelines on the decisions
 that must be made during georeferencing and the tradeoffs they entail.
 Finally, we introduce machine learning based methods to overcoming the
 weaknesses of any particular data source or georeferencing choice.
 Our ensemble tools allow for the sophisticated combination of gazetteers
 while discerning best probable matches given the underlying features and
 empirically discovered problems of the data.These tools can be adapted to
 any conflict where at least a portion of the location descriptions can
 be reasonably linked to known, accurate coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, our tools do have limitations of which researchers should be
 aware.
 To conduct the diagnostics and generate appropriate hand rules as well
 as to properly train the semi-supervised ensemble, one needs a subset of
 the data with a reasonably accurate `ground truth.' For media-based events,
 this could be constructed by analyzing potential overlaps with GPS-based
 military records (such as the Significant Activities data for Iraq and
 Afghanistan).
 For historic conflict data, one would likely be reliant on the archival
 records themselves to provide this sample (as many British records do).
 Machine learning techniques also require more technical expertise and computati
onal costs than current approaches to georeferencing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings also suggest a number of important insights for both producers
 and consumers of conflict event data.
 At a minimum, there needs to be greater transparency and documentation
 of the steps taken during georeferencing.
 When multiple strategies are available, the chosen one should be theoretically
 and empirically justified.
 Ideally, alternative georeferencing decisions would be explored and included
 in the data release, enabling sophisticated robustness checks.
 Our analysis also indicates that all users of event data should be highly
 cognizant of the data generating process.
 The historical record is a product of the decisions, incentives, and constraint
s of individuals and institutions, who are themselves embedded in the social
 processes they have documented.
 At a minimum, we must try to understand the underlying biases in our data
 and not magnify their effects.
 With sophisticated tools, as we have tried to develop, we may even be able
 to mitigate such biases.
