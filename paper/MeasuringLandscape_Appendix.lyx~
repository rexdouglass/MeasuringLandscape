Gazetteers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We employ a number of different gazeteer sources for this analysis including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 1964 Official Kenya Gazetteer (United States Board of Geographic Names,
 1964)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 Board of Geographic Names’ database of foreign geographic feature names
 or NGA (http://geonames.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.html)
\end_layout

Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gazetteer Coverage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We subset each gazeteer to just the region of interest covering the conflict.
 As you can see, the spatial coverage varied wildly from source to source,
 with some like Geonames having very densive coverage of this area to others
 like Openstreetmap having relatively sparse coverage.
 Coverage for both Google and Bing map APIs is based on just the set of
 entities returned when searching for the toponyms in our events data, not
 their full coverage of this area.
 We further exclude entities that did not have a textual label associated
 with them (e.g.
 many of OpentStreetMap's features).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gazetteer Resolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each source has an implicit spatial resolution based on how it was created
 and whether and how those coordinates were translated (e.g.
 from degrees to decimal).
 By far the noisiest source was the digitization effort of the International
 Livestock Research Institute, with both coarse precision and noticeable
 artifacts of points lying directly on latitude and longitude map lines
 which were omitted or pushed to the side.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This appears to be an artifact of the automated process employed by a commercial
 vendor several decades ago.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The historical gazetteer was presented in minutes and seconds, limiting
 its maximum precision to about 2km on the ground.
 NGA and geonames are a combination of the historical gazetteer as well
 as new points drawn from other sources with a plausibly higher resolution.
 Openstreetmap is drawn directly on satellite imagery by humans, but also
 imports some off the shelf data.
 Wikidata has a noticeable truncation to the whole degree.
 Our events locations have a known spatial resolution at the grid square,
 which our conversion to latitude/longitude gives a smooth but false sense
 of accuracy.
 In sum, when considering absolute maximum spatial precision we recommend
 a known error bounding box of at least 2km around any gazeteer entry.

Allow Self-Referential Matching?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building a gazeteer from source data itself is promising but potentially
 problematic.
 We wish to flag one concern in particular.
 If spatial auto-correlation is a concern, then self reference is a technique
 that builds in a mechanical spatial correlation from points with shared
 names.
 For example, if the toponym was Nairobi, it represented a polygon covering
 a large area, but the only observed events with coordinates were in a single
 small ward of the city, then imputing those same points to other events
 that perhaps occurred in other wards, would mechanically introduce spatial
 auto-correlation as well as error.

Which Geometry Type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of our gazeteers included mixed geometry types, including points,
 polygons, and lines.
 How to deal with these correctly is an open research problem.
 We chose to take centroids, as points that were unbiasedly representative
 of the overall feature.
 In the future, researcher may prefer instead to sample from the entire
 feature in a way that is either more representative or reflects the uncertainty
 of representing a large area only a single point.

Type of String Matching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce the concept of fuzzy matching but did not have space to describe
 the approach in the paper in detail.
 Our fuzzy matching pipeline has three major steps, stemming, locally sensitive
 hashing, and a supervised classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing two toponyms, how should we decide when they are referring
 to the same real world location and when they are actually referring two
 different real world locations? This is a difficult task for several reasons.
 The first is that relatively little information is conveyed by a string
 alone outside of the context in which it was used, e.g.
 the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Paris
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not enough to uniquely distinguish between a vacation to Paris, France
 or a one to Paris, Texas.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Having done both, an author would like to convey that there is a difference
 between these two vacations and that it is very important to know this
 beforehand.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Second, the way topynms are used (and abused) in natural language text
 leads to many different unique strings referring to the same underlying
 toponym.
 We have enumerated just some of the ways toponyms are misrepresented in
 natural language text in our event data, shown in tables below.

Training Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We treat this a supervised learning problem and develop a hand labeled dataset
 of toponym matches (3,192) and mismatches (17,051).
 We construct a training dataset by taking events with both text and coordinates
 (5,128), pairing them with the ten gazetteer entries closest in geographic
 proximity.
 Removing duplicate diads reduces the number to 20,242 diads.
 Excluding exact matches reduces it further to 18,405 diads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Stemming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Toponyms often include a mix of uniquely identifying tokens (stems) and
 generic place type descriptions (postfixes) like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

farm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

estate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hospital
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.
 This creates a problem for string matching for two reasons.
 First, postfixes are not used consistently, appearing in some entries for
 the same place but not others.
 Second, postifixes make toponyms look similar because of their type but
 not necessarily their geography.
 We therefore develop a rule based toponym stemmer.
 We took the 14,885,300 unique names and alternate names, stripped off the
 first word of each, leaving 8,740,662 unique suffixes.
 To account for multiword stems and to ensure we capture broadly applicable
 postfixes we further require them to appear at least 5 times, resulting
 in 161,034 unique postfixes.
 For example, the five most common postfixes globally are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (63,214), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (28,225), and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cemetery
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (27,345).
 Across the 57,903 unique toponyms/descriptions across both the events and
 combined gazeteers, we find 45,131 unique stems, and 2,546 unique postfixes.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Locally Sensitive Hashing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the number of pairwise comparisons that must be made scales
 quadradically in the number of items, over a billion comparisons for our
 moderately sized dataset (k^2 / 2 = 45,131 stems^2 / 2= 1,018,403,580),
 and so using direct comparisons is impractical.
 We therefore introduce an intermediate culling stage based on approximate
 matching.
 The goal is to strike a balance that minimizes the number of false negatives
 at the cost of a reasonable number of false positives.
 The approach we employ is called Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), and
 it proceeds in two steps (Leskovec et al.
 2010, chapter 3).
 First, we convert each toponym into a standardized sparse vector of binary
 features.
 Q-gram distance performed well as a feature in later stages, so we choose
 2-character ngram profiles as our sparse feature set.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Grams are simply counts of characters {'a','b','1'}, pairs of characters
 {'ed','ac'} , sets of three characters in a row {'abc','ing'}, etc.
 Skip grams extend this idea to allower for gaps between pairs or tripplets,
 e.g.
 {'a_c','c_e'}, etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The similarity between any two profiles is measured as the Jaccard distance
 which is the just the count of shared items in both sets divided by the
 total number of items in both.
 To avoid having to calculate that distance for every single pair of items,
 we apply a hash function that assigns two items to the same id with some
 probability as monotonic function of their Jaccard distance.
 By using multiple hashes, one can choose an arbitrary threshold for which
 items below a certain distance will be matched with very high likelihood.
 The advantage is this procedure only requires a single pass through the
 entire set of items.
 The downsides are that it is approximate, provides only a hard yes or no
 match, and there is a trade off between retrieving too many suggestions
 and losing too many real matches which must be hand tuned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the hand labeled training data, we experimentally determined the optimal
 combination of gram features, and hash hyperparameters.
 We settled on 2-chaaracter ngrams, and LHS parameters of 100 minihashes,
 25 bands, and 4 rows.
 On our training data, this produced a recall rate of 0.88 at the cost of
 an average of 29 suggestions per item.
 These pairs that pass the first sage's bar then go on to the second stage
 for further refinement and a direct estimate of the likelihood of a match.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This figure shows the results of a grid search over number of bands used
 in locality sensitive hashing.
 The number of minihashes is fixed at 100, and so the number of rows is
 the number of minihashes divided by the number of bands, which we vary
 over 50,25,20,10,5 and 2.
 The outcomes are the number of total suggested matches returned (both true
 and false) per event location, and the number of false negatives (true
 matches that are accidentally rejected).
 Using an elbow rule, the best trade off appears to be 25 bands and 4 rows.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Training and Test Split
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For training the next stage of the classifier, we refine our dataset of
 hand labeled toponym and mismatches into a training and test split.
 First, to ensure the classifier is invariant to the ordering of the diad,
 we add the inverse of each diad and remove duplicates again, leaving 34,496
 directed diads.
 To construct the test split, we first stem each toponym and then randomly
 select 500 stems to serve as a test split.
 Any diad, with a toponym on either end that shares one of those 500 stems
 is excluded for the testing split.
 The final division is 27,161 training directed diads and 5,521 testing
 directed diads, with 1,815 and 308 positive examples respectively.

Fuzzy Matcher
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We train a classifier to predict the likelihood of match between two toponyms
 as a function of properties of each.
 We consider both the full strings and also their stems.
 We employ a number of string distance measures as features (Santos et al.
 2017), described in the table below.
 For each, we employ a number of types of string distance (Jaro, Optimal
 String Alignment, Levenstein, Damerau Levenshtein, Longest Common Substring,
 q-grams 1-5, cosine, Jaccard, and a count of the number of matching letters
 before the first mismatch).
 We include a count of the number of characters of A and B and the difference
 between the lengths.

 The method, in brief, is a greedy function aproximator, additively combining
 multiple functions, that are estimated one at a time, each seeking to account
 for the residuals of the prior functions (Friedman 2001).

 In our case, each function is approximated by a nonparemtric decision tree
 which starts at a root node containing every observation, and progressively
 splits observations into purer and purer subsets using cut points along
 their covariates.
 We employ a custom loss function, seeking to minimize the log likelihood.
 We account for the class imbalance by proportionally weighting positive
 and negative cases.
 To avoid over-fitting, we use early stopping, based on area under the receiver
 operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set.
 We observe convergence at about 20 iterations.

Four features contribute disproportionately, Jaro Distance of the stems,
 the cosine distance of 2-character ngrams of thes stems, 2 and then 3 character
 ngrams of the full toponym, and then a gradual decline from there on.
 Through combining different string distance measures, the model is deriving
 ways in which two strings might match, by both starting with the same word,
 sharing long substring toward the end, requiring small spelling changes
 to match, etc.

 The ngram statistics of the search string flag as important, particularly
 how often it appears and median and mean year of appearance in the text

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce a supervised learning approach to choosing the optimal gazeteer
 match from among multiple possible matches.
 The unit of analysis is the location-gazeteer suggestion diad.
 In total we have 539,268 diads, of which 340,355 are labeled because of
 the availability of known military coordinate.
 The outcome is the observed distance between the gazeteer suggestion and
 the known true location (min 0km, mean 44 km, median 28 km, max 747km).
 We divide the labeled cases into five mutually exclusive approximately
 equal folds for cross validation.
 We split on unique event location names, so that multiple matches to the
 same event location text or multiple event location texts with different
 military coordinates don't appear in both the training and validation sets.
 Therefore the hold out sets aren't exactly balanced, ranging from size
 34 thousand to 114 thousand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features we employ are: gazeteer source, geometry type, fuzzy or exact
 string match, and self reference; reporting district, the year of the event,
 and what level geographic aggregation the event was reported at, e.g.
 city, district, or province level.
 We further include the predicted probability of a match genderate by the
 model from the second stage of the fuzzy toponym matcher.
 Additionally, we include a one-hot encoding of the gazeteer feature type
 (PPL=54,391, STM=31,207, ADMD=19,009, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model we employ is again XGBoost, implemented in the R package xgboost
 (Chen et al.
 2016).
 We minimize the mean squared error (on the log transformed distance in
 kilometers).
 To avoid over-fitting, we employ early stopping after 10 rounds, converging
 in 63 iterations.
 The model has an out of sample 5 fold cross-validated root mean squared
 error of 1.033 log km.
 Its predictions are monotonic but not linear in the true distance, shown
 in the figure below.
 We therefore find it plausible that the ensemble will do a good job in
 rank ordering matches from best to worst, but perhaps not guessing correctly
 how far away a particular match is.
 The supervised ensemble's rank order correlation with true distance is
 0.47, compared to the set of fixed handmade rules whose rank order correlation
 is 0.37.
 Visual inspection of the predictions and residuals on a case by case basis
 reveal the model does a good job distinguishing top ranking matches from
 poor alternatives, but there is little information available to further
 sort between poor matches.
 Poor matches tend to be indistinguishably bad from one another.

 The Mau Mau administered two types of oaths: the first was administered
 broadly to civilians and bound them to silence.
 Reporting rebel movements, plans, or activities to government officials
 was considered a violation of the oath.
 The second level of oath was only administered after the first oath and
 only to those committed to participating in Mau Mau.
 It was referred to as the Batuni (or killing) oath.

Predictability of Missingness

\begin_layout Standard
In the paper we present results from a model predicting the likelihood of
 an event to be missing exact military coordinates as a function of a number
 of properties of the event as well as the document it was drawn from.
 We show that location information is not missing at random, it is missing
 systematically, and systematically in ways that are correlated with both
 outcomes, covariates, and confounders that would go in any typical downstream
 analysis of these data.
 We replicated this excercise for other types of missigness (military coordinate
s, text labels, coordinates and labels), and for missingness following imputatio
n by every strategy and decsision discussed.
 Those results are presented in the figure below.
 Again the model is XGBoost implemented in the R package xgboost (Chen et
 al.
 2016).
 The unit of analysis is the event.
 The loss function is log loss with proportionally weighted cases to account
 for class imbalance.
 The measure of accuracy of the model (predictability of missingness) is
 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.
 Values near 0.5 are close to random accuracy, and values close to 1 are
 perfect accuracy.

This figure shows the predictability of missingness of location information
 for the raw data as well as each imputation strategy.
 The features are properties of each event, such as the perpetrator, target,
